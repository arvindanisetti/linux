# Computer Networking for DevOps - Workshop Notes

## Overview
The video discusses how the internet functions, focusing on the connection between computers across different locations, and illustrates this through examples, particularly using Netflix as a reference.

## How the Internet Works
- **Understanding Connectivity**:
  - The speaker engages the audience by asking how they believe the internet operates.
  - Visual aids, including maps, are used to represent geographical connections, particularly highlighting India and how it connects to other networks.

- **Requesting Data**:
  - When accessing a site like Netflix, a request is made through a web browser (e.g., by typing www.netflix.com).
  - This request uses the HTTPS protocol, which facilitates the rendering of web pages that contain HTML and CSS.

## Technical Components
- **Server IP Address**:
  - Websites like Netflix have IP addresses associated with their servers, which users don't need to remember.
  - Domain Name System (DNS) serves as a directory that translates domain names (e.g., www.netflix.com) into IP addresses.

- **Analogy with Phone Books**:
  - The DNS functions similarly to a phone book, mapping domain names to their respective IP addresses to facilitate smoother navigation on the internet.

- **Data Transfer**:
  - The process of data transmission involves optical cables and wires that are laid under oceans. These enable connections from one geographical location to another.
  - In requests, the information travels from the user's device through local servers and internet service providers (ISPs) to reach the final destination.

## Demonstration of Concepts
- **Practical Analysis**:
  - The speaker presents a live demonstration of how internet requests are processed. Using a command to trace the path of data to Netflix shows the various points (hops) involved in the journey from the userâ€™s computer to the server hosting Netflix.
  
- **Investigating IP Addresses**:
  - By entering specific IP addresses, the speaker illustrates how to identify the routing of data, including which provider handles the connection (e.g., Tata Communications).
  - Locations such as Mumbai and international routing to other cities (like Paris) highlight the global infrastructure of the internet.

## Conclusion
This session lays a foundation for understanding the mechanics behind the internet, which is critical for aspiring DevOps engineers to grasp how networks manage data requests and responses. The knowledge of DNS and the physical infrastructure supporting internet connectivity provides essential insights for working effectively in DevOps contexts.

# Computer Networking for DevOps - Overview Notes

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Understanding IP Addresses
- Each device on a network requires a unique IP address.
- An example calculation:
  - A building with 800 IP addresses can represent 100 buildings.
  - Thousands of such neighborhoods could exist, leading to millions of IP addresses in a country like India.
- Total available IPv4 addresses are **4,294,967,296** (approximately 4.2 billion), which are limited.

### 2. Limitations of IPv4
- The current IPv4 addressing scheme is limited due to the growing number of devices connected to the internet.
- If a household has multiple devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets), the demand for IP addresses can exceed the available addresses.
- Participants were prompted to consider if the available IPv4 addresses would become insufficient in the future.

### 3. Transition to IPv6
- *IPv6* was introduced to address the limitations of IPv4.
- Total available IPv6 addresses are **340 undecillion**, which is significantly higher than IPv4, ensuring that there wonâ€™t be a shortage in the foreseeable future.

### 4. Structure of IP Addresses
- IPv4 addresses use a dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- IPv6 addresses appear more complex, typically represented in hexadecimal and separated by colons.

### 5. The Concept of Subnets
- Subnetting allows a larger network to be divided into smaller, manageable sub-networks.
- Within a subnet, unique IP addresses can be assigned while conserving the limited IPv4 addresses.
- The concept of subnet masks was discussed, allowing better routing and organization of IP addresses within a network.
- Devices connected to the same subnet can share an IP address, depending on the network setup.

### 6. Practical Use and Applications
- The workshop emphasized the importance of understanding both IPv4 and IPv6, as well as subnetting, for roles in DevOps and network management.
- Real-world implications of these concepts affect how you design networks and manage device connectivity.

## Summary
The workshop provided a comprehensive overview of computer networking concepts relevant to DevOps, particularly focusing on IP addressing, the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, and the role of subnetting in efficient network design. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for networking professionals and aspiring DevOps engineers to navigate the complexities of modern networking.
