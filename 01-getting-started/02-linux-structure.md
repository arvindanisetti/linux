(a) Hardware Layer

ðŸ”¹ The physical components of the computer (CPU, RAM, disk, network interfaces, etc.).
ðŸ”¹ The OS interacts with hardware using device drivers.

(b) Kernel (Core of Linux OS)

ðŸ”¹ The Linux Kernel is responsible for directly managing system resources, including:

    Process Management â€“ Schedules processes and handles multitasking.

    Memory Management â€“ Allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.

    Device Drivers â€“ Acts as an interface between software and hardware.

    File System Management â€“ Manages how data is stored and retrieved.

    Network Management â€“ Handles communication between systems.

(c) Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)

ðŸ”¹ A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.
ðŸ”¹ Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.
ðŸ”¹ Converts user commands into system calls for the kernel.

(d) User Applications

ðŸ”¹ End-user programs like web browsers, text editors, DevOps tools, etc.
ðŸ”¹ Applications interact with the OS using system calls via the shell or GUI.

(e) System Libraries

ðŸ”¹ Provide the APIs and runtime support for applications and utilities.
ðŸ”¹ Examples: glibc (GNU C Library), libm, OpenSSL, which provide critical functionalities like standard input/output, math operations, cryptography, and networking.
ðŸ”¹ Act as a bridge between user applications and the kernel system calls, simplifying development.
ðŸ”¹ Libraries enable portability of applications across different Linux distributions.

(f) System Utilities

ðŸ”¹ These are basic command-line tools and programs that facilitate system management and user tasks.
ðŸ”¹ System utilities often come from the GNU coreutils or other essential packages.
ðŸ”¹ They are crucial for Linux administration, scripting, and automation.
    
    File operations: ls, cp, mv, rm

    Text processing: grep, awk, sed

    Process management: ps, top, systemctl

    Networking: ping, ip, netstat
